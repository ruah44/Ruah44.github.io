### Compulsory/Core modules

Music Perception and Cognition

Music is a fundamental part of being human and exists only in the mind of the listener. This module will provide students with advanced training in current understanding of how musical sound is processed by the mind and brain. This is crucial for developing creative tools for musicians and intuitive interfaces for music lovers as well as for using technology in the creative production of new music.

Project

The aim of the MSc project is to give students the opportunity to apply to a significant advanced project, the techniques and technologies, that they have learned in their lecture modules. Projects will either be significantly development based, or else have a research focus. All projects will be expected either to investigate or to make use of techniques that are at the leading edge of the field. Candidates will be asked to submit a project report on completion of the allotted project period (3 months full time). This report will be evaluated using the standard criteria for scholarly work. Projects will also include a viva where students will be required to demonstrate and defend their work.

### Compulsory/Core Elective modules

Fundamentals of DSP

Introduction: Why DSP, sampling, quantization, Signals, LTI systems, Z transforms and polynomials, DFT, FFT, Spectrum Analysis, FIR filters, IIR filters

### Elective modules

Interactive Digital Multimedia Techniques

This is a Master's level course in developing real-time interactive digital media systems. The course will focus on graphics and sound programming, with a secondary emphasis on basic electronic hardware design for sensors and human-computer interfaces. The course will employ widely-used development environments including Arduino, Processing Max/MSP and Jitter, Processing. Course material will be delivered through a combination of lectures, interactive lab sessions, and individual/group exercises (both in and out of class). Generally speaking, each class period will consist of a combination of lecture and interactive lab session.

Sound Recording and Production Techniques

The module develops the students' skills and understanding of contemporary audio production techniques. It will give the students a good grounding in the theoretical aspects of audio production, from the functionality of audio interfaces to the signal processing within audio effects, as well as providing practical experience in the use of all audio equipment to which the theory applies. The students will learn the implications of audio digitisation, through which they will gain an understanding of the various means by which digital media is disseminated in the modern age.

Machine Learning

This course covers methods for machine learning from signals and data, including statistical pattern recognition methods, neural networks, and clustering. The aim of the course is to give you an understanding of machine learning methods, including pattern recognition, clustering and neural networks, and to allow you to apply such methods in a range of areas.

Big Data Processing

Music Informatics

This module introduces students to state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of music data, with a focus on music audio. It presents in-depth studies of general approaches to the low-level analysis of audio signals, and follows these with specialised methods for the high-level analysis of music signals, including the extraction of information related to the rhythm, melody, harmony, form and instrumentation of recorded music. This is followed by an examination of the most important methods of extracting high-level musical content, sound source separation, and on analysing multimodal music data.

Music and Audio Programming

This module will introduce a broad class of principles of programming music and audio systems, with a particular focus on real-time digital signal processing on embedded hardware. Students will develop audio projects using the Bela embedded hardware platform, which is based on an ARM Cortex-A series processor, an architecture also commonly found in mobile devices. This is a project-based module, with the overall mark determined by two smaller assignments and one more extensive final project. It is expected that students already understand basic digital signal processing theory and have a moderate familiarity with programming in C, C++ or a similar language.

Deep Learning for Audio and Music

This module, for those who have some prior knowledge of machine learning, focusses on deep learning methods and how they can be used to address many tasks in audio and music. The theory of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) is covered, including training of common DNN types as well as modifying DNNs for new purposes. Various tasks in analysis/generation of audio and music are studied directly to inspire the content, using raw audio and/or symbolic representations. Background in machine learning is essential, and some background in digital signal processing is highly recommended. Music knowledge would be desirable but is not a requirement.

Interactive System Design

The main areas of study are (i) interaction and design (ii) modelling of interaction (iii) the design process (iv) design principles and (v) usability evaluation. Various types of interfaces will be considered including those encountered on the web and mobile computing devices. A historical perspective is encouraged in order to provide a means of understanding current and projected developments in the discipline and profession of interactive computer system design. The module will include seminars and group laboratory classes in which analysis, design and evaluation methods will be used in practical contexts. Students will be expected to participate fully in the seminars by presenting and discussing their own designs and evaluations. Students will be required to construct prototype interfaces using techniques of their own choice (e.g. Java, Director).
