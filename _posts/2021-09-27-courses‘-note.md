# Music Perception and Cognition

Music is a fundamental part of being human and exists only in the mind of the listener. This module will provide students with advanced training in current understanding of how musical sound is processed by the mind and brain. This is crucial for developing creative tools for musicians and intuitive interfaces for music lovers as well as for using technology in the creative production of new music.

Perception感知 and Cognition认知

Temporal Lobe 颞叶 processes what we hear, “We use the language center to appreciate music, which spans both sides of the brain, though language and words are interpreted in the left hemisphere while music and sounds are inerpreted in the right hemisphere,” Yonetani says.

# Interactive Digital Multimedia Techniques

This is a Master's level course in developing real-time interactive digital media systems. The course will focus on graphics and sound programming, with a secondary emphasis on basic electronic hardware design for sensors and human-computer interfaces. The course will employ widely-used development environments including **Arduino, Processing Max/MSP and Jitter, Processing.** Course material will be delivered through a combination of lectures, interactive lab sessions, and individual/group exercises (both in and out of class). Generally speaking, each class period will consist of a combination of lecture and interactive lab session.

# Music and Audio Programming

This module will introduce a broad class of principles of programming music and audio systems, with a particular focus on real-time digital signal processing on embedded hardware. Students will develop audio projects using the Bela embedded hardware platform, which is based on an ARM Cortex-A series processor, an architecture also commonly found in mobile devices. This is a project-based module, with the overall mark determined by two smaller assignments and one more extensive final project. It is expected that students already understand basic digital signal processing theory and have a moderate familiarity with programming in C, C++ or a similar language.

# Interactive System Design

The main areas of study are (i) interaction and design (ii) modelling of interaction (iii) the design process (iv) design principles and (v) usability evaluation. Various types of interfaces will be considered including those encountered on the web and mobile computing devices. A historical perspective is encouraged in order to provide a means of understanding current and projected developments in the discipline and profession of interactive computer system design. The module will include seminars and group laboratory classes in which analysis, design and evaluation methods will be used in practical contexts. Students will be expected to participate fully in the seminars by presenting and discussing their own designs and evaluations. Students will be required to construct prototype interfaces using techniques of their own choice (e.g. Java, Director).

# The Semantic Web

The idea of putting semantic information on the Web has been around for a long time: we now have the beginnings of a practical application. This  has its foundations in what is called Description Logic, which strikes a good balance between tractability and usability. This has led to a Web  language called OWL, which is at the centre of modern work on the  Semantic Web: there are now useful implementations, and there are  workable, if modest, applications of this technology.

# Music Informatics

This module introduces students to state-of-the-art methods for the  analysis of music data, with a focus on music audio. It presents  in-depth studies of general approaches to the low-level analysis of  audio signals, and follows these with specialised methods for the  high-level analysis of music signals, including the extraction of  information related to the rhythm, melody, harmony, form and  instrumentation of recorded music. This is followed by an examination of the most important methods of extracting high-level musical content,  sound source separation, and on analysing multimodal music data.

Sound Recording and Production Techniques

The module develops the students' skills and understanding of contemporary audio production techniques. It will give the students a good grounding in the theoretical aspects of audio production, from the functionality of audio interfaces to the signal processing within audio effects, as well as providing practical experience in the use of all audio equipment to which the theory applies. The students will learn the implications of audio digitisation, through which they will gain an understanding of the various means by which digital media is disseminated in the modern age.

Deep Learning for Audio and Music

This module, for those who have some prior knowledge of machine  learning, focusses on deep learning methods and how they can be used to  address many tasks in audio and music. The theory of modern deep neural  networks (DNNs) is covered, including training of common DNN types as  well as modifying DNNs for new purposes. Various tasks in  analysis/generation of audio and music are studied directly to inspire  the content, using raw audio and/or symbolic representations. Background in machine learning is essential, and some background in digital signal processing is highly recommended. Music knowledge would be desirable  but is not a requirement.

# Project and Dissertation

Examples of past projects include: 

- Content-based music recommendation
- Toward understanding convolution neural network in instrument classification
- Learning global-context music embeddings for music recommendation
- Convolutional neural networks for general-purpose audio classification

The aim of the MSc project is to give students the opportunity to apply to a significant advanced project, the techniques and technologies, that they have learned in their lecture modules. Projects will either be significantly development based, or else have a research focus. All projects will be expected either to investigate or to make use of techniques that are at the leading edge of the field. Candidates will be asked to submit a project report on completion of the allotted project period (3 months full time). This report will be evaluated using the standard criteria for scholarly work. Projects will also include a viva where students will be required to demonstrate and defend their work.
