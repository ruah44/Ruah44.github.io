## 生命：幼崽的第一步

（2021-07-27）和妈一起看的。水獭幼崽很幸福妈妈过于幸苦。绝大多数一次只生育一只幼崽的动物都是由妈妈照顾，人类需要反思父系和父权。

## 大猫 Big Cats (2018)

（2021-07-26）作为纪录片而言，拍摄主题模糊，剪辑和组织混乱，猫科都没介绍全，共性差异也没讲啥。很难看。这么高分受捧真是沾太多猫科动物的光了。

## 白色巨塔

某人在这部作品后近二十年的选本给我留下的自恋大男子形象通过这部剧又加深了…

## [其后](https://movie.douban.com/subject/1294580/)

夏目漱石原著。

## Blue Period 

1-45话 ：画画需要坦率面对自己，因为创造是一种自我揭露。不努力的孩子，是没有爱好的孩子。面部形成“笑”的肌肉动作和精神感到快乐，何者在前呢？宝物本。在申请的时候，我说"我感到这个领域是有趣、美好的，因此想去做它。"其实我在说谎。在做到一定地步之前，我知道自己是根本不了解这个领域的。我知道很多时候，热情在初学技术或者刚刚取得资格跨进门槛的时候便逐渐熄灭。比起景象的吸引力，行动、思考、探讨的能力，为人本身的能力可能更关键。看着八虎以及他的同道同伴们，我感到了鼓舞，又觉得很虚弱…觉得自己依然站在很靠近起点的地方… PS 作品的性别观念：作者是女性，主人公及其同伴主要是无特别装饰的普通男性，也有喜欢穿迷你裙、会去酒吧陪男客的龙二、有着莫名其妙的超长双马尾的桥田这样自我装饰方面很特异的男性，很多镜头似乎刻意画得美丽且色情；目前出场多的老师们以及最初引导主角进入美术世界的人则主要是女性，突出她们深暗的精神和思想、以及与主角交流时强劲的魄力，很多镜头画得宛如黑化；剧情上刻画了美大教授中唯一女性受到的歧视和压力。

## 猫科动物 

（2021-07-31）由龙女之声制作。两集约1h。看了两遍。

食肉目猫科下分为两个亚科。豹亚科代表物种有虎（Panthera tigris）、狮（Panthera leo）、豹（Panthera pardus）、美洲豹（Panthera onca）、雪豹（Panthera uncia）、云豹（Neofelis nebulosa）。猫亚科分七个谱系，代表物种有美洲狮（Puma concolor）、猎豹（Acinonyx jubatus）、家猫（Felis catus ）、狞猫（Caracal caracal）、金猫（Catopuma temminckii ）和伊比利亚猞猁（Lynx pardinus）。

## 岚少实况 Ib恐怖美术馆

（2021-08-04）花了一上午看掉了6P…昨晚看还是挺恐怖的。

## 爱的迫降

（2021-08-06）想看但第一集就弃了，不过富豪掌权人继位还是让给女儿好，容易沾染上问题癖好的男儿就谚语所谓"富不过三代"的原因。

## 《尖帽子的魔法工房》

开头几话后弃，似乎世界观和角色行为没有很强的真实感，魔法的基本发生方式也是老实地揭示了出来，但是画风很有卡牌风，如果是儿童向+买周边应该很强吧。

## 炎拳

（2021-08-06）1-8卷看完。整体上感觉为了拔高疯狂、残酷和象征性而把剧本设置得十分（不）精（科）神（学）化，很缝合怪，高张力高刺激但感觉经不住思考。男主夸伪妹妹的各种日式cos"好可爱啊"那个并页真的震撼到我，恶心吐了，虽然一开始哥哥对妹妹说的“多吃饭好长胸部肉”的调侃就很劝退，明明是一个未来废土冰河期村落，有重视救赎与奇迹的基督教式宗教，细节处却泛着当代日本男的尸胺味，这和作为故事背景偶尔会涉及的那种动物层次的粗俗奸杀和取乐很不一样，用那类在无发展人性道德的环境时的雄性暴力给现代日式空虚意淫男的意识体遮羞，让我觉得很恶心。还有那个吃睡撸的电影仔，因为被发现身体是女孩头脑是男性然后突然脆弱闹别扭，过于后现代文化了，真的让人大跌眼镜。电影仔拍过家家电影，就像作者写故事，貌似张力是很强的，让人好奇内在究竟是怎样，结果真的只是过家家。记两个很精彩的两个思路，一是关于某人回答当初为什么屠村，说是因为以男主无偿分享的再生人肉为食的村子——“留下的只会是吃人的文化”，而或许重要的不仅是“活下去”，而且是（作为【人？】？？？地）“活下去”，另一点是那句，“想死的话我没意见，但是别死在我面前，要死就去我看不到的地方死吧。”——总之很有共感。也许我目前的心态更喜欢克制且向上的玩具，而不是自爆自毁的神作……或者作者肚里剖出的米粉。总之接着看《链锯人》，再看新短篇。

说明受到瞩目拥有地位与被歧视并不矛盾。

黑人剧把黑人当作取笑对象，通常由把脸涂黑并画夸张妆容的白人男性扮演，这点似乎与中西方早期戏剧中女性角色通常由男性扮演的规定如出一辙。我一开始觉得这种思路很奇怪，不知道为什么如此一致，但也许歧视者就是通过传播这些故事、段子，广义上地扮演被歧视者、制造刻板印象来维持这种歧视的。可能人心底里很容易明白这种歧视给自己带来了巨大收益，所以能自发地认同并使用这些拐弯抹角的歧视手法，不管是男扮女还是白人扮黑人。联想到某些声称平权和进步的观念，以及作品，在我眼里反而更像是维护刻板印象，以弱势之名剥夺弱势本身的声音。

（2021-08-08）好看！！“马修·邓斯特执导，保罗·希尔顿饰演浮士德博士，亚瑟·达维尔饰演魔鬼梅菲斯特费勒斯。”这个浮士德比较坦率，梅菲很有人性，教皇和皇帝好生动。亮点在于穿插的一些富有历史感的阴间低俗搞笑。对楼上伴奏的乐器很好奇。七宗罪来串场时弹幕笑称“娘家人”，似乎存在浮梅CP，叫faustopheles。最后的一人提着一个血腥人偶的集体舞真可爱 hahah——

  >
  > “To have no food for our heads, no food for our hearts, no food for our activity, is that nothing? If we have no food for the body, how do we *cry out*, how all the world hears of it, how all the newspapers talk of it, with a paragraph headed in great capital letters, DEATH FROM  STARVATION! But suppose one were to put a paragraph in the Times, Death of Thought from Starvation, or Death of Moral Activity from Starvation, how people would stare 瞪 , how they would laugh and wonder!

  > MORE THAN the lady with the lamp, the saviour of the men in Crimea

  >Bronte’s *Jane Eyre*:
  >
  >Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties 才智 and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation 滞, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more **privileged** fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings.

According to this idea, men played an active role in the public sphere of work and politics, while women’s role was or should be limited to the private  sphere of the home and family.

- #### women’s contribution to the Victorian workforce

  > Second half of 19th century (later period of Victoria era): 
  >
  > - In 1871 approximately 32% of the workforce was female and 55% of  single women worked outside the home (compared to 10% of married women).
  > - In England and Wales between 1851 and 1881 the number of women employed had increased from 2.3 million to 3.3 million.
  > - Domestic service was the most common form of employment (1.5 million women were **domestic servant**s in 1881, an increase of over half a million since 1851). Domestic servants worked very long hours, had **low pay and status and were vulnerable to abuse**.
  > - The second largest occupational group among women were **textile worker**s. As industrialisation deskilled a large number of jobs in this  sector and reduced pay, the number of women employed increased, overtaking the number of men employed by 1861. Women were paid only a  fraction of that paid to male workers, **earning between a third and sixth of the wages paid to men**, and they were **barred from better paid jobs**. For instance, there’s evidence from the London School Board in the 1890s that teachers had to receive a salary that was 3/4 of that given  to male teachers. So oftentimes, these **unequal wages or salaries they weren’t just informal arrangements.** They were actually **regulated and stipulated**. 
  >
  > - 'The Angel in the House'? - NO. Many of middle-class women never undertook any form of paid employment during their lifetimes. In fact, many middle-class women in particular engaged with unpaid work in the form of charity work, voluntary work, particularly in the latter part of the century– engaging in home visiting, domiciliary revisits, and going out and doing charity work. And a great deal of very hard work was done it just wasn’t paid employment.
  >
  > By the end of 19th century and prior to WW1 (Edwardian Era): 
  >
  > - **White Blouse Revolution** - The civil service: new employment opportunities for women: office clerks, secretaries, typists, and shop assistants, viewed as being more respectable than domestic service - easily be exploited by employers? (1870 Education Act had a profound impact on increasing levels of literacy.)
  > - Large numbers of women were still  employed in ‘sweated trades’ such as clothing workshops, suffering long  hours, low pay and terrible conditions.
  > - Most male dominated trade unions were suspicious of women workers,  anxious that they were undercutting men’s wages. As a result few women  were members of a union.
  > - **Marriage** curtailed women’s opportunities to work: It’s the 1940s before married women allowed to remain as  teachers, as civil servants. And really, the marriage part goes right  the way through in some sectors even to the 1960s, when, in fact, the  banking sector is the final sector that allows married women to stay in  their employment. Issues such as discrimination in pay and working conditions were important factors in leading increasing numbers of women to conclude they needed the **vote**.

##### [To learn!!] [*Women and Work*](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/women-and-work) (1857) a radical pamphlet by Barbara Leigh Smith, leader of the ‘Langham Place group’

- #### women’s status and rights (or lack thereof) as defined by the law

  > - Great Reform Act of 1832 explicitly limited the vote to men, placed restrictions in terms of the women’s vote. **Prior to this there had been no language around gender and the franchise** 选举权. - "In Britain, women were given the franchise in 1918." Women at this point are not allowed to hold any property of their own. 
  > - Prior to 1832 there had been a few– not many at all–  but a few instances of women who met the property qualification actually voting. So we see **in the early part of the 19th century a greater restriction of women’s political rights**. Women at this point are not allowed to hold any property of their  own. All their property is actually accorded to their husband. Any  property that they bring at the point of marriage, any wages, if they  are in any form of paid employment. Any wages they earn, in fact belong  to their husband. Women aren’t allowed to write their own will. They’re not allowed to sue or be sued.

  > **Custody of Infants Act 1839**
  >
  > This law allowed women who had separated from their husband the right to apply for the custody of children under the age of 7.
  >
  > **Matrimonial Causes Act 1857**
  >
  > Before this change in the law, divorce was only possible via a  private Act of Parliament, an expensive procedure only accessible to the very wealthy. The Matrimonial Causes Act created instead a Divorce  Court and legal proceedings became more affordable.
  >
  > However, the terms on which a man or woman could apply for a divorce  were not equal. Men had only to prove their wife had committed adultery. Women had to prove that their husband had committed adultery *and* been cruel or had deserted her.
  >
  > **Married Women’s Property Act 1870**
  >
  > Whereas traditionally a woman’s property, past, present and future  (including wages), had legally been the property of her husband upon  marriage, this law allowed women to keep property or income they had  acquired after marriage.
  >
  > **Married Women’s Property Act 1882**
  >
  > This law extended the terms of the 1870 Act to include all property and income, regardless of when it had been acquired.

  > Barbara Bodichon’s [A Brief Summary of the Most Important Laws Concerning Women](https://archive.org/stream/briefsummaryinpl00smit#page/n5/mode/2up), published in 1856, is one of the most important works examining women’s legal status in Victorian England.

- #### pioneering women who rallied against social, cultural, economic and  legal restrictions in a time when they were excluded from voting because of their gender. 

  - Caroline Norton: instrumental in raising the profile of issues surrounding custody of  children, divorce and women’s rights to property (or lack thereof upon  marriage). 与律师丈夫分开后被其控告并夺走写作所得财产，于是利用法律制造负债成功复仇。在其中一个孩子已死之后终于取得了见到自己孩子的权利。【法律】
  
  - Hannah More : described by Anne Stott as ‘the first Victorian’, was a pioneering advocate for women’s education and a prominent figure in the abolitionist 废奴主义者 movement, campaigning for an end to the Slave Trade. - an evangelical Christian - So her education campaign and her abolition campaign weren’t  designed to improve the social mobility of disadvantaged classes, but so that they could fulfil their function in God’s kingdom.【教育】【outspokenness under the cloak of Christianity: More was a contradictory figure. She was socially conservative and yet charged with being subversive and despite being an anti-feminist she pioneered a new political role for women. She wrote a series of things called “The Cheap Repositories  Tracts,” which taught people, the poor, that you need to read only in  order to read the Bible so that you can know your place in society.当时女性“安全有效地”参与公共/政治的途径 - 作为宗教信徒，维持守旧保守的一面，也有很多因发声而陷入麻烦的女性。proto-feminists like Mary Wollstonecraft or the Republican  historian, Catherine McAuley or Helen Maria Williams, a radical writer】【a self proclaimed anti-feminist】

  - Elizabeth Jesser Reid: a higher education college for women. In 1849 she established the first such institution in England: Bedford College, only received a dozen or so at  first, mostly from Reid’s friends.
  
    Notable students of Bedford College in its early days included the artist Barbara Bodichon and novelist George Eliot, both discussed in  earlier steps.
  
  - Sarah Parker Remond **(**1815-1894), who studied languages at Bedford College, broke  many barriers for women, travelling around the US and UK without a male  escort to make speeches against slavery. She also signed the first mass  petition calling for women’s suffrage, presented to Parliament in 1866.
  
  - Emily Wilding Davison (1872-1913), who studied English at Royal Holloway in 1893, became a prominent  figure in the Women’s Social and Political Union, one of the women’s  suffrage organisations we will learn about next week. She joined the **WSPU** in 1906 and quickly began to undertake militant forms of protest.  She was imprisoned on numerous occasions and went on hunger strike in  the name of the women’s movement. Her best remembered act of protest resulted in her death, when she  walked out in front of King George V’s horse during the 1913 Epsom  Derby.
  
  - Hilda Martindale (1875-1952)
  
  - Mary Elaine Sykes (1896 – 1981)
  
  - Josephine Butler: 1. campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases (venereal disease, sexually transmitted disease (STD)) Acts that made the question of women’s sexuality and women’s sexual availability and the sex trade part of political debate 2. the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act raised the age of consent to 16 (while the criminalisation of homosexuality was tagged onto this act)
  
  - Helen Blackburn: two key issues: suffrage and women’s employment. Secretary to the London-based ***Central Committee of the National Society for Women’s Suffrage*** between 1874 and 1880 and Secretary of the *Bristol and West of England Society for Women’s Suffrage* between 1880 and 1895. delivered speeches across Wales and the West Country and penned various pamphlets, including the 1881 and 1895 editions of *A Handbook for **Women Engaged in Social and Political Work*** - an encyclopaedic guide for women wishing to support the suffrage movement. an early historian of the early suffrage movement, writing ***Women’s Suffrage: a record of the women’s suffrage movement in the British Isles* (1902)**. From 1880 to 1895 she was also either editor or joint editor of the *Englishwomen’s Review*. a representative of the *National Union of Working Women* as a suffrage advocate at the 1881 TUC (Trade Union Congress), sat on the executive of the *Society for Promoting the Employment of Women* and campaigned against so-called ‘protective’ legislation.
  
    > In a good many trades the men wish to get rid of the women, especially  if the women’s part of the work happens to be pretty well paid; they are then apt to represent the dangers incurred by women in an exaggerated  manner, and if the Committee contains supporters of the men’s trades’  unions, such representations meet with ready acceptance. -- Blackburn, The Condition of the Working Women and Factory Acts* (1896)

  很不开心……看到第二周的某课后提问，你认为 Pankhursts’ increasingly militant tactics 是帮助还是阻碍了women’s suffrage，回复区全部都在论证是阻碍。仿佛之前大半世纪都是白讲的一样。怎么回事……
